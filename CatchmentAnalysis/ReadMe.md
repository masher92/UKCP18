# Leeds Urban Catchments

Leeds City Council (LCC) defined 46 urban catchments in Leeds. Of these, 22 represent distinct sub-catchments which can be matched approximately to FEH catchment boundaries. Figure 1 shows the shapes of these 22 catchments in comparison to the outline in blue of the sub-catchments defined by LCC. The remaining catchments defined by LCC are sub-catchments of major rivers (Aire, Wharfe, Nidd and Calder).
