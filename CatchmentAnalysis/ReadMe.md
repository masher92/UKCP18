# Leeds Urban Catchments

Leeds City Council (LCC) have defined 46 urban catchments in Leeds. The boundaries of these catchments are defined in blue in Figure 1.

The FEH web service identifies the catchment area upstream of a catchment outlet point. For each catchment it generates:
* The catchment boundaries as a shapefile;
* Design rainfall depths for pre-defined return period/duration combinations;  
* Catchment descriptors based on the Integrated Hydrological Digital Terrain Model (IHDTM).

Using the FEH web service, 21 catchments with boundaries closely matching those identified by LCC have been identified and are shown on Figure 1. The LCC catchments which couldn't be generated in the FEH web service are sub-catchments of major rivers (Aire, Wharfe, Nidd and Calder). The area of these 21 catchments range between 5km<sup>2</sup> and 71km<sup>2</sup>.

The catchment descriptors file generated by the FEH webservice contains various metrics related to the climate, drainage characteristics and soils in the catchment. Some characteristics that are likely to cause sensitivity to high intensity rainfall and to influence pluvial flood risk are:

* ALTBAR: Mean catchment altitude (m above sea level), derived from the IHDTM.
* BFIHOST: Catchment Average Base Flow Index. This is measure of catchment responsiveness derived using the 29-class Hydrology Of Soil Types (HOST) classification. Values over 0.65 represent permeability, and those below 0.65 represent an impermeable catchment.
* SAAR: Average annual rainfall in the standard period (1961-1990) in millimetres.
* URBEXT2000: Index of urban and suburban land cover in 1990 / 2000 expressed as a fraction. A value of less than 0.3 represents a rural catchment, and more than 0.3 an urban catchment.

In Figures 2-5, a histogram and a chloropleth map are plotted of the values of each of the metrics across the 21 catchments.

In Figure 6 a (weak?) negative relationship is seen between increasing urban extent and base flow index. Higher base flow indices are associated with permeability and so it follows that the highest values of BFIHOST would be associated with the lowest urban extent. In Figure 7 a positive relationship is seen between catchment altitude and average areal rainfall.
