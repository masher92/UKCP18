*	Select ‘Profile Lines’ at bottom left of window
*	Select yellow pencil (add Line)
*	Have based location of my named Profile Lines on the ones Megan used in her report. Check exact reason for this.

Calculating the timeseries -> Flow over a profile line doesn't work for some of the scenarios. Can't work out why.
Also very slow --> is this just my PC?

Can also just right click at any point on the map and select TimeSeries. Can then get a timeseries of Depth. This is maybe better than using profile lines, because for profiles lines you can only get flow rather than depth (presumably because it couldn't just give one depth value over the whole profile line, whereas flow is calculated across the whole profile).
Would be useful to establish whether over a profile line this plot for depth varies much.
