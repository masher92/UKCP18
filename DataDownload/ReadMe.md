## Data download

<ins>UKCP18 Projections</ins>  
The projections are available via an FTP connection from the CEDA data catalogue. The UKCP18.py script automates download from here.  
It is also possible to access the data through a User interface at https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/user/login?next=%2Fsubmit%2Fform%3Fproc_id%3DLS3A_Subset_01  
So far, have downloaded 2.2km hourly precipitation projections, ensemble member 01, 1980-1990.

<ins>Observations</ins>  
CEH-GEAR-1km data is not available via FTP, and has to be downloaded manually from: https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/datastore/eidchub/d4ddc781-25f3-423a-bba0-747cc82dc6fa/.

<ins> To Do </ins>  
Could this be set-up to clip the data to the Leeds region on download to save on memory requirements?
