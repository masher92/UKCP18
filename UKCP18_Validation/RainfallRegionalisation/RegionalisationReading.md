Rasheed et al (2019) -- Delineation of homogenous rainfall regions for water sensitive urban design is primarily based on long term overall rainfall characteristics (e.g. average annual rainfall chracteristics, average number of wet/dry days) 
and not the homogeneity of event based rainfall characteristics e.g. antecedent dry days, rainfall intensity, total rainfall and total duration of rainfall events. 
Regions may seem similar based on overall rainfall characteristics but may not be for event based rainfall events.
