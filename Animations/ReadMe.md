## Animations  

Creates animations over the whole of the UK, or trimmed to a more local area, which cycle through the hourly precipitation projections.  

The purpose of this is to provide a means of testing whether a timeseries created for a particular location seems to be accurate.  
For instance, the time-series of precipitation values for a location in Leeds for 1981 is shown below.

then can then animate the precipitation for 1981 with that location marked on the map and visually check whether the plot seems to be showing the right information.
