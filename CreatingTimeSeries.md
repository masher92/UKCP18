** Creating long time series  
Hourly values are provided for both precipitation observations and projections and these are provided grouped into monthly data files covering the whole of the UK.  
For this analysis, we are interested in producing a long time-series, for instance covering the whole of one of the contiguous periods for which data is provided (e.g. 1981-2000, 2021-2040, 2061-2080) for one grid square which covers a location of interest.
