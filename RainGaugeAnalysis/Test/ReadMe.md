An extra idea to test smoothing out of data away from gauges:
•	For a gauge find the timeslice with an extreme value
•	For each of N surrounding grid cells find the precipitation value in this same time slice (or in, say, 3 timeslices before and after to allow for the fact there is some offsetting in gauge/CEH-GEAR data)
•	Plot these values spatially, to look at patterns

Checking if regional stats overlain with gauges are for JJA or whole time period (wouldn’t be fair comparison if only JJA (altho probably most extreme precip values occur in JJA anyway)
