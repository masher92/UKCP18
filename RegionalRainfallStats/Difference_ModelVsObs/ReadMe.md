# Percentage difference between Model and Observations

The mean value across the twelve UKCP18 2.2km model ensemble members are calculated for various statistics of present day rainfall. The difference between these mean values and those found in the CEH-GEAR observations data, regridded to 2.2km, are then calculated to establish the presence of model bias.

# Difference between Model and Observations

For mean, model is too wet over some higher regions (e.g. Pennines and Scotland) compared to observations, but is too dry over some other high regions (e.g. Welsh mountains). Would probably expect model to be too wet everywhere (although recently moisture conservation in models has been improved so they are less likely to be really wet), but would probably still expect this bias to be there. Would expect model to capture more extreme values, whereas they might be interpolated in observations dataset. This might influence mountains especially if there are less likely to be gauges there; however, there might be some correction for topography in CEH-GEAR dataset (and the way this is done might be relevant for the results). 
Most of plots are all red (99.5 onwards), so model has extremes which are higher than the observations.

Plot as percentage so the plots are more comparable -- percentage of total.

95th and 97th percentile -- showing an underprediction in the model, which doesn't match the pattern in the other. 
All hour data - rains maybe 10% of the time - so might be in a drizzle/light rain regime. If model has got more wet days, once you get down to lower percentiles, potentially including dry days or some very light rain days in one of the datasets and not the other.
But mean and 99th percentile look very similar? Well mean (total rainfall) might be dominated by evenst where you have at least substantial amount of rainfall, whereas lower percentiles might actually correspond to rainfall events which have lower rainfall amounts than which contribute to the mean. Getting head around which percentile contributes most. Which regime is mean representative of? Mean probably corresponds to a high percentile.   
Georgaphical differences over Leeds ar enot huge, so probably dont need to look at the maps - can plot PDFs instead.

### Comments
Map is topography related (some topographical patterns), but also other stuff going on.
Good thing - not a 'map of stations' - suggests that influence of interpolating the data is limited. 
Plots kind of what you'd expect, magnitude of bias maybe lower than they were in UKCP09 (or in previous versions of CPM) where wet bias would've been larger. 
Bit of a surpise is North/South divide in bias in mean, would have expected it to be red everywhere.
