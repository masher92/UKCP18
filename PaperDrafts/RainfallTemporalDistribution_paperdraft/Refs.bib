	isbn = {978-0-415-30607-2},
	abstract = {Environmental and engineering aspects are both involved in the drainage of rainwater and wastewater from areas of human development. Urban Drainage deals comprehensively not only with the design of new systems, but also the analysis and upgrading of existing infrastructure, and the environmental issues involved. Each chapter contains a descriptive overview of the complex issues involved, the basic engineering principles, and analysis for each topic. Extensive examples are used to support and demonstrate the key issues explained in the text. Urban Drainage is an essential text for undergraduates and postgraduate students, lecturers and researchers in water engineering, environmental engineering, public health engineering and engineering hydrology. It is a useful reference for drainage design and operation engineers in the water industry and local authorities, and for consulting engineers. It will also be of interest to students, researchers and practitioners in environmental science, technology, policy and planning, geography and health studies.},
