# Extreme Value Theory

* EVT seeks to ass events more extreme than those previously witnessed
* It does this by fitting a distribution to the most extreme observed events, and treating them as being drawn from their own extreme value distribution 
* Where time-series from models or observations are short the number of observed extremes may still be too small to allow the distribution to be characterised properly
* To get around this, can pool data spatially
* Data must be pooled from spatially homogenous regions.
  * Homogenous in respect to what?
  * "It is assumed that the region is homogenous after adjustment for spatial variations in parameters (e.g. only the mean might vary across a region)
